I’m a Frontend Engineer.
I love creating intuitive user interfaces and building seamless API integrations.

I’m driven to solve problems involving human-computer interaction on unique product teams.
I want to work on B2C subscription-based applications. Example - Pinterest, Airbnb, and Spotify.

Feel free to reach out if you’re building something exciting and hiring for Frontend Engineer roles.
